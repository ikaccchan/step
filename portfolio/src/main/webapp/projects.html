      <h2>Here are some of the projects I've completed in the past: </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Rate My Professor Post Classifier (Python)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Utilized scikit-learn and numpy libraries to preprocess text 
          data and convert them into 0-1 vectors</li>
          <li>Analyzed the effect on the result of multiple performance 
          metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc) from various Support 
          Vector Machine models</li>
          <li>Experimented with different hyperparameter selections, feature 
          engineering, algorithm selections (linear vs. quadratic), and 
          multiclass methods (one-vs-one vs. one-vs-all) to classify 3000 
          posts</li>
        </ul>
        <br></br>
        <li>The Walking Deadline (C++)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Independently read about and implemented several kinds of 
          an unfamiliar data structure</li>
          <li>Implemented a priority queue interface that uses template generic 
          code, inheritance, and dynamic polymorphism</li>
        </ul>
        <br></br>
		    <li>Treasure Hunt Game (C++)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Created a command line application that takes in a customized 
          treasure map and outputs the treasure path in either map or 
          text format</li>
          <li>Utilized deque as both stack and queue to implement iterative 
          BFS and DFS traversal</li>
        </ul>
        <br></br>
        <li>Piazza Post Classifier (C++)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Implemented recursive binary search tree functions by managing 
          dynamic memory allocation</li>
          <li>Utilized naive Bayes model in machine learning to predict a most 
          likely label for piazza posts and achieved an accuracy of 87% when 
          tested on large data sets</li>
        </ul>
        <br></br>
    	</ul>
